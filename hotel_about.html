               <p>When you come to a hotel room, you want it to be grand, functional and beautiful. But you don't want things that are not useful. Sometimes you go to hotels and there are all these frames and pictures of people you don't know, and you end up hiding everything in the drawer, and then housekeeping come and put it out again,But the strange thing about hotel rooms is that they look familiar and seem familiar and have many of the accoutrements that seem domestic and familiar,but they are really weird,alien and anonymous places.I love  this palce.</p>

            <p>I stayed as a single person for an overnight visit. It was the perfect size and space for what I needed. Very clean and comfortable. I originally booked a single, but was upgraded to a double. I think it would have definitely on the small side if I were sharing that space it another person, though. The hotel staff was very kind and accommodating,Had a brilliant stay.It was clean,in a good location,served a great breakfast and the staff were extremely helpful.Would definitely recommend and would certainly stay here again.
